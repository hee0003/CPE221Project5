# CPE221Project5

I will be adding a druid class to this project.
There will be two spells the druid can do: Flaming Sphere and Healing Word.
The druid class will have the special quality of either wisdom or dexterity that the spells' damage and healing are based on.
Flaming Sphere will have a damage of 1.0 * (wisdom or dexterity).
Healing Word will have a healing amount of 2.0 * (wisdom or dexterity).
